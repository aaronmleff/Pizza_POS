In SEIS 635, Software Analysis and Design, students learned basic object-oriented techniques for designing and implementing a software application. Specifically, we focused on Unified Modelng Language (UML), a general-purpose modeling language that provides a standard way to visualize software design. The instructor required that students work in teams of three or four to create a Point of Sale(POS) application using object-oriented techniques in the language of their choice.

I collaborated with two other students to create a Pizza POS. The three of us had beginning-intermediate knowledge of programming with Java as our only commonality. I have included the final project in this repository.
